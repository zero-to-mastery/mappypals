# Important!

-   **Think in Components** - exmple: a **Button** can be created as a component of its own which can then be reused across the application. Building this way helps with consistency and resuability.

-   **Organize and group things as much as possible**. The bigger our codebase grows, the more likely it is for bugs to occur, but keeping code and features orginzed helps in tracking down defects.

-   **Let others know what you're work on**. You can do that posting in the **#mappypals** discord channel. This will help ensure that different people are not seperately building the same feature/functionality.

-   Use the **#mappypals** Discord channel to discuss and ask questions about the app.


## How to Write CSS
- **Reuse UI folder elements** - [UI folder](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/mappypals/tree/dev/src/components/UI). Instead of creating new elements. Reuse elements from UI folder.

- **Use classes instead of selectors** - Do not write .p{} instead use classes.
